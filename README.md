###Goals###
Implement a system to classify new posts [^fn-post_def].  To classify a post we will attempt to assign a keyword to the post.  It may be possible that an assigned keyword does not match what the user had intended.  In that case a list of other possible keywords will be shown or the user can create one.

###Footnotes###
[^fn-post_def]: A post refers to a post on twitter for the purposes of this application.  However this would be able to be applied to any set of sentences which have keywords identified.
