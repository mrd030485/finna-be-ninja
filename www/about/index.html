        <h2>FP Classifier</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Mark Dazey</p>
            <p><em><strong>Updated: 2013-02-19</strong></em></p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Implement a system to classify new posts [^fn-post_def].  To classify a post we will attempt to assign a keyword to the post.  It may be possible that an assigned keyword does not match what the user had intended.  In that case a list of other possible keywords will be shown or the user can create one.</p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <h3>Footnotes</h3>
            <p>[^fn-post_def]: A post refers to a post on twitter for the purposes of this application.  However this would be able to be applied to any set of sentences which have keywords identified.</p>
